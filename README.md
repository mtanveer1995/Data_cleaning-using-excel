# Data_cleaning-using-excel
In this Repository I have cleaned tha data as per below mentioned steps:
Where name is missing in the sheet I have extracted the names and fill the name values.
In the age column I found some missing values. Filled them by calculating mean of the age column.
In the phone number column I came across that there is the wrong format updated so I have just fill the column by - +91-xxxxxxxx.
I deleted the rows were name and email_id were missing.
I highlighted the top 10 highest salary employees working in the company.
In the department column there were many data found which was update in the wrongly(uppercase and lowercase were not found in correct format). for this issue I made them correct.
Where there is no address found I have updated as Address not Available.
